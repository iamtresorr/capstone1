An e-commerce website template built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

This project was a task assigned to me in the YearUp program. The task was to create an e-commerce store, selling any product of my choice. The brand name is Kunda. The product(s) that I choose to sell were customizable 3D characters for web deisgners and developers. Design-wise, I was going for a mordern, minimalistic look. The technologies that I used to develop the website are HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Below is a preview of the landing page.
